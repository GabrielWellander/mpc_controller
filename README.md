Creating an mpc controller for the BlueROV2

I have included all the files to be able to make a rospackage.
A few changes might have to be done on your machine to make it work.
This rospackage is made for ROS Noetic.

The packages needed to make it work are:
- freefloating_gazebo
- freefloating_gazebo_demo
- mavlink
- libmavconn
- mavros-msgs
- bluerov_ros_playground
- mavros_extras
- test_mavros
